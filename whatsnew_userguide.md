# What's new in release 1.1 - WidgetApp user guide
We've made some changes to WidgetApp to enhance your design experience with Things.
- A new Streaming service that runs in the background will make the design process faster, with quicker updates to your Things file.
- Multiple users can now work on the same Thing at the same time.

***Comments***
- Target audience: non-technical (designer) user, focused on the changes to the user interface and basic functionality - so this is the focus for the content as well.
- Content placement in guide structure (Table of Contents, TOC): most likely at the top of the document. If there was already a section or table for release 1.0, this would slot in just below.
- Questions I would ask (potentially more things to document at a user level):
  - I took it that the Streaming service is mostly transparent to the designer user, but is it fully transparent? Would there be progress or performance indicators?
  - If WidgetApp is now moving to a multi-user experience, would there be UI elements (buttons, icons, chat or communication pop-ups) to interact with other users?
  - What about error messages or conditions for user group validation?
