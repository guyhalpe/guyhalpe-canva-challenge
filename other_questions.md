# Other questions, comments
This document contains other questions or comments that came to mind while doing the challenge.
1. **Sentence case and title case**: I noticed that Canva generally has a convention of using sentence case for titles, but I see exceptions to this on the Canva website. I tried to find an internal Canva typographical standards or conventions document that would have guidelines for this, but I haven't found one yet. 
2. **Typographical errors**: I'm not sure if I was intended to list these, but here they are:
   - View 9, bullet 1: chooses > choose
   - View 12, bullet 6: Steaming > Streaming
