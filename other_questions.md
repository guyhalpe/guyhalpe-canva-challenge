# Other questions, comments
This document contains other questions or comments that came to mind while doing the challenge.
1. **Sentence case and title case**: I noticed that Canva generally has a convention of using sentence case for titles, but I see exceptions to this on the Canva website. I tried to find a design standards or conventions document that would have guidelines for this, but I haven't found one yet. 
2. I noticed some typographical errors. I'm not sure if I was intended to list them, but here they are:
  a. Chooses > choose, slide 14, bullet 1.
  b. xfdlkl;dfgm
