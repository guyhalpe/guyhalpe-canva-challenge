# Guy Halpé - challenge 2, three What's new sections for WidgetApp

## Introduction

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show you what I can do, and for your time reviewing this challenge.

I've tried to follow the challenge presentation style conventions, and made this repository (repo) *public* for easy access. Please let me know if you would prefer it to be *private*.

## Repository contents

- `README.md`, this file, contains introductory comments on my process, approach and the contents of the repo. 
- The three **What's new** sections are in three separate Markdown (.md) files with logical filenames:
  - [`whatsnew_userguide.md`](https://github.com/guyhalpe/guyhalpe-canva-challenge/blob/main/whatsnew_userguide.md)
  - [`whatsnew_adminguide.md`](https://github.com/guyhalpe/guyhalpe-canva-challenge/blob/main/whatsnew_adminguide.md)
  - [`whatsnew_apiguide.md`](https://github.com/guyhalpe/guyhalpe-canva-challenge/blob/main/whatsnew_apiguide.md).
- [`other_comments.md`](https://github.com/guyhalpe/guyhalpe-canva-challenge/blob/main/other_comments.md) contains other questions and thoughts I had while doing the exercise.
- Each of the **What's new** section files is structured this way:
  - First the text for the **What's new** content section, with footnote links to serve as inline comments.
  - Below it, a **Comments** section that covers my thoughts and questions.
  - Lastly, footnote details.

## Approach to the Challenge

- **Sizing and level of detail**. I felt that any **What's new** section should be short and simple, and a concise summary of a more complex piece of functionality. So that's how I've written the three sections. I've intentionally kept things as simple as possible, keeping text chunking within the section short too. Readers wanting more details would be able to go to the relevant sections of the respective guides, using a hyperlink in the **For more information** subsection.
- **Target audience**. With each section, I wrote specifically to a level of complexity that I felt best reflected the target user. I placed myself in their position and tried to address the concerns that they would have.
- **Release versioning**. For the purposes of this challenge and to provide some context when referring to legacy and new functionality, I've invented a release version **1.0**, with the new functionality linked to release version **1.1**.
