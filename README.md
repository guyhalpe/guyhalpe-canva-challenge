# Guy Halpé - Challenge 2, three What's new sections for WidgetApp

## Introduction

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show you what I can do, and thank you for your time reviewing this Challenge.
- I haven't used Markdown before, or created my own repository (repo) in Github, so didn't include the time taken to learn these new technologies as part of the 3 hours allocated to the challenge.
- I've tried to follow the Challenge presentation style conventions.
- I've made this repo Public for easy access. Please let me know if you would prefer it to be Private.

## Repository contents

- `README.md`, this file, contains introductory comments on my process, approach and the contents of the repo. 
- The three **What's new** sections are in three separate Markdown (.md) files with logical filenames:
  - `whatsnew_userguide.md`
  - `whatsnew_adminguide.md`
  - `whatsnew_apiguide.md`.
- `other_comments.md` contains other questions and thoughts I had while doing the exercise.
- Each of the **What's new** section files is structured this way:
  - First the text for proposed **What's new** content section, with inline footnote links for comments.
  - Next, a **Comments** section that covers my thoughts and questions.
  - Lastly, footnote details.

## Approach to the Challenge

- **Sizing and level of detail**. I felt that any **What's new** section should be short, simple and a summary of a more complex piece functionality - in other words, a release note - so that's how I've written the three sections. I've intentionally kept things as simple as possible, keeping text chunking within the section short too, so that those wanting more detail can link to the relevant sections of the respective guides.
- **Target audience**. With each section, I wrote specifically to a level of complexity that I felt best reflected the target user. I placed myself in their position and tried to address the concerns that they would have.
- **Release versioning**. For the purposes of this challenge and to provide some context when referring to legacy and new functionality, I've invented a release version **1.0**, with the new functionality linked to release version **1.1**.
