# Guy Halpé - Challenge 2, three What's new sections for WidgetApp
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show you what I can do.

Some comments:
- The three **What's new** sections are in three separate Markdown (.md) files with logical filenames:
  - whatsnew_userguide.md
  - whatsnew_adminguide.md
  - whatsnew_apiguide.md.
- Release versioning: for the purposes of this challenge, I've invented a release version **1.0**, with the new functionality linked to release version **1.1**.
- The other_comments.md file contains other questions and thoughts I had while doing the exercise.
- I haven't used Markdown before, or created my own repo in Github, so did not include the time taken to learn about these as part of the 3 hours allocated to the challenge.
- I've tried to follow the Challenge presentation style conventions.
- Inline comments are inserted as footnotes.
- I've made this repo Public for easy access. Please let me know if that's not your preference.
