# Guy Halpé - Challenge 2, three **What's New** sections for WidgetApp
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show you what I can do.

Some comments:
- The three **What's new** sections are in three separate Markdown (.md) files with logical filenames:
   - whatsnew_userguide.md
   - whatsnew_adminguide.md
   - whatsnew_apiguide.md.
- Since the new content needs to be seen in context, I'd assume that some form of release versioning is in place. So for the purposes of this challenge, I've linked the legacy functionality to release version **1.0**, and the new functionality to release version **1.1**.
- The other_comments.md file contains other questions and thoughts I had while doing the exercise.
- I haven't used Markdown before, or created my own repo in Github, so did not include the time taken to learn about these as part of the 3 hours allocated to the challenge.
- I've tried to follow the Challenge presentation style conventions.
- Inline comments are inserted as footnotes.
- I've made this repo Public for easy access. Please let me know if that's not your preference.
