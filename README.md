# Guy Halpé - Challenge 2, three **What's New** sections for WidgetApp
Thank you, Canva, for giving me this opportunity to show you what I can do. Some comments about the files below:
- I haven't used Markdown before, or created my own repo in Github, so did not include the time taken to learn about these as part of the 3 hours allocated to the challenge.
- The three **What's new** sections are in three separate files.
- I've tried to stick to the Challenge presentation style conventions.
- Since the new content needs to be seen in context, I'd assume that some form of release versioning is in place. So for the purposes of this challenge, I've linked the legacy functionality to version **1.0**, and the new functionality to version **1.1**.
- Comments are inserted as footnotes.
- I've made this repo Public for easy access. Please let me know if that's not your preference.
