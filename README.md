# Guy Halpé - Challenge 2, three **What's New** sections for WidgetApp
Thank you, Canva, for giving me this opportunity to show you what I can do. Some comments about the files below:
- I haven't used Markdown before, or created my own repo in Github, so did not include the time taken to learn about these as part of the 3 hours allocated to the challenge.
- The three **What's new** sections are in three separate files.
- I've tried to stick to the Challenge presentation style conventions.
- Comments are inserted as footnotes.
- I've made this repo Public for easy access. Please let me know if that's not your preference.
